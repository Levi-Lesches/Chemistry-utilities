# Chemistry-utilities
A collection of chemistry helper programs. I have not run some these programs anywhere except my own computer, and although I plan to upgrade the code quality in an upcoming project, for now this is code I wrote when i was 16 and in a hurry. 

## balance.py
Balances chemical equations using matrices and linear algebra. 

## cheerios.py
A program to answer the question: How deep would a mole of cheerios cover the Earth?

## chemicals.py
Tells you the name of a compound you type in. Compounds must have at most two elements, since this is all I learned in class. 

## chemistry.py
Draws molecular diagrams of compounds. A severe limitation is that the bonds betwene the atoms have to be hard-coded in advance. Because of this, it is configured to show the example compounds: C2H6, CO2 (carbon dioxide), H2O (water), NH3 (ammonia), C2H6O, and C6H12O6 (glucose).

## elements.py 
A full Periodic Table of the Elements, optimized for Python. I did not write this, I found it online and am including it since it is a dependency in some files. 

## sigdigs.py
A significant figures calculator. Make sure to use parenthesis where required. 

## test_balance.py
A hard-coded list of tests for `balance.py`.
