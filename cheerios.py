"""
A program to determine how a mole of Cherrios(TM) would destroy all life.

Works by determining how many Cheerios it would take to cover the Earth
(adding more to the radius to account for existing Cheerios) over and over
again until it can't anymore, then converts from cm (everything is in cm)
to kilometers...using dimensional analysis!!!

Assumptions: 
- cheerio dimensions: 
	- radius: 0.75 cm
	- height: 0.5 cm
- Earth radius: 6,371 km
- packing cheerios: 
	- make a "box" around each cheerio
	- the box will have a radius of 2(radius of cheerio)

# I Googled this value (and will refer to it as "R" in comments):

MOL = 6.022 * (10 ** 23)
# Since Cheerios are circular, we will fit it in the smallest possible box
# (ie, a length and width of the diameter of a cheerio). The area of this
# box will be d^2 = (2r)^2 = 4r^2.
